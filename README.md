ML can be broadly categorized into supervised and unsupervised approaches. Supervised ML is centered around predicting an output from a set of inputs, whereas unsupervised ML centers around creating data-driven patterns and groupings within the input data without a labeled output. In this study, we are doing a comparison by training our model on different supervised ML algorithms  
* Multiple Linear Regressor
* Decision Tree Regressor
* KNN Regressor
* Random Forest Regressor
* Gradient Boosting Regressor
